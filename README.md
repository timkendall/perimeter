A modern (Node.js) video surveillance system. Supports multiple cameras (IP, HDMI, USB) as well as motion detection, facial recognition, and more.

## Goals
The goal is for this to be an alternative and more powerful surveillance system for people with existing setups and who are tired of their clunky DVR systems. Here are the features I hope to support - 

* Standard 24/7 video recording
* Support for existing IP cameras
* Smart motion detection
* External event API (for Smart Home integration)
* Push notifications for events
* Facial recognition (i.e "Bob just got home")
* License plate recognition
